# Project: Sentiment Analysis using pytorch

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Sentiment Analysis model using Tensorflow to determine the sentiment of a movie review. The model is a recurrent neural network using LSTM gates that was trained on the IMDB data set. The LSTM model gives the accuracy of 89%.
